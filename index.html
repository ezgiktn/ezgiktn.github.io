<p align= "center"> <i>  There are a lot of famous computer scientist in the world and they have provided many contributions to computer science. One of them is Alan Turing. He is a computer scientist born on June 23, 1912, in London.</i>
<br> <p align="left"> <i>His teacher is aware of his intelligence while he is six years old and he begins to solve the problems of didderentiation and integration at the age of fourteen. Moreover, it is focused on problems of Albert Einstein's at the age of sixteen.He goes to the Cambridge University because he is good at Math and he graduated with high degrees. After that, he has contributed to many areas of work.</i></p>
<br> <p><i>In The Second World War, Alan Turing has contributed to the country. He worked in the solution of the Enigma machine which used for the purpose of secret messages encrypted by Germany. He developed Bombe Enigma machine that broke the Enigma code.  He managed to break Enigma and, he contributed  to the war.</i></p>

<br> <p> <i> In 1946, Alan Turing  worked in the national physics lab for ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) and in 1950 , he made the first program. He who works in computer lab in Machester University and prepares the Manchester Mark 1 software started to work on artificial intelligence and machine intelligence. As a result of study, he found out Turing test which shows a machine as intelligent human.</i></p>

<br><p> <i>  All in all , Alan Turing has contributed a lot to science with superior intelligence.  Turing machines was inspired to people and now we call computer that machine. Hormanol therapy was given the penalty for Turing was gay. Two years later, he committed suicide  by eating a cyanide apple On June 7, 1954.  They argue that it is suicide , but the emblem of " rainbow colors " the " symbol of homosexuality also occurred and died from the scientist's argument shows that the bitten apple .</i></p>
